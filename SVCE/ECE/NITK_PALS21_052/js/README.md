myFunction():
  Alerts the user if length exceeeds the given range.

	Else if in the given range:
   	The length specified is read and used to calculte and display the timePeriod and Frequency(in Hz and rad/sec).
    For changing the length and the timePeriod of the pendulum animation in the display box as per the input
	  Amplitude vs Time Graph is plotted based on user's lenght input.
		      init():Plotting is initialised
					draw():The ouput grph is plotted by calling the plotSine() and showAxes() function
					showAxes():X and Y Axis is drawn
					plotSine():The response for amplitude vs time plotted on the axis based on user's input


start():
	Used to resume the osscilation of pendulum.

stop():
	Used to stop/pause the osscilation of pendulum.
